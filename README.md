# Neuro-Machine-Translation



This repository contains the code to create a machine translation model which will translate one language to another.

There is two implementaion:
1. Simple Seq2Seq model
2. Seq2Seq model coupled with attention (Shows better performance)

The implementation is in keras.

My implemntation is based on english to bengali translation but same can be implemented for other languages also as long as the structure of the data is same. I have included spanish, japanese data also. 

I have used pretrained word embeddings from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip for better performance.
